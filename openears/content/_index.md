## 🌿 You’re Not Alone. I’m Here to Listen.

Life can get heavy sometimes.  
We all go through moments where we just need someone — not to fix things, but simply to **listen**.

I’ve been through my own tough times in life, and I know how much difference it makes when someone genuinely hears you out.  

That’s why I created this space — a place where you can talk freely and feel understood.

### 💬 No Fees. No Judgement. Just Listening.

- 💸 **No charges involved** — this is not a service, it’s a gesture.  
- 🫶 **No judgement** — you can speak your mind without fear.  
- 🕯️ **Safe & private** — your identity will always remain confidential.  
- 🗣️ **Just listening** — I’m not a certified therapist, and I don’t offer professional advice. I’m simply here to **hear** what you want to share.
